                    <p><i class="fa fa-film text-primary"></i> Over nine years ago we met in the mold-stained humidity of Xtra-Vision. Kevin had already worked there at one point in a part-time stint over a year or so. Since leaving to work elsewhere, Gemma joined the company. Love didn't really blossom but both became friends in Xtra-Vision, regularly doing late shifts serving the good people of Finglas their returns following accidental "<em>reading film</em>" forays. Not long after Kevin's re-entry to the magical world of selling drug dealers two phones at a time, Gemma was promoted to management. One of her first tasks was to clean the floor. She asked Kevin to hoover when he had a chance. Kevin's version of the story is that he didn't do it, leaving Gemma confused as to what to do. Gemma's version is that Kevin did this in a huff. The debate rages on...</p>
                    <p>Time passed on and as Gemma & Kevin became better friends they eventually formed a strong relationship. The early years were fun primarily because there was a whole <em>will-they, won't-they</em> secret discussion among colleagues. If anything, this was an impetus to keep the relationship going. And go, it did.</p>
                    <p>Some time passed when the fledgling couple went on a holiday with friends to Turkey. This was a test for the relationship because it was our first time to do such a thing. A few days into the 10-day holiday Kevin contracted a crippling illness brought about by street food. Days of sickness left Kevin many lbs lighter, but Gemma continued her holiday blissfully. At the end of the holiday, Kevin had to pack Gemma's bags for her after a night out at 5am left her incapacited before the flight.</p>
                    <p>As the years rolled on, we become stronger, closer and better as a couple. But one thing kept the bond stronger than any other thing could have. <em>Toast</em>. Kevin is about as sarcastic as a human can be, and this spills into regular conversation. "<em>Kevin, would you like to go to a restaurant tonight?</em>" "No." This means yes, with lots of enthusiasm. So Gemma invented a phrase that kept the relatinship alive. 'Toast' is the word she says to make Kevin revert form his natural state of ultimate sarcasm, and say what he means.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><i class="fa fa-2x fa-diamond wow bounceIn text-primary" data-wow-delay=".1s"></i></p>
                    <p>After many years, in 2014, Kevin flew Gemma to Boston & New York for a holiday after his annual work conference. Don't go to Boston on holiday, it's incredibly boring. New York, however, is great. And it was midweek during our holiday that Kevin popped the question in Time Square in the most awkward manner possible. You can hear the full story at the ceremony after we've had some wine. But it's funny.</p>
                    <p>What we're trying to say is that we've had nearly a decade of stories to share. Some funny, some lovely, some utterly baffling. And that's why, in 2016, we're going to get married. That, and Kevin keeps talking about his taxes. <i class="fa fa-heart wow bounceIn text-primary"></i></p>

              <p><i class="fa fa-3x fa-plane text-primary"></i> The airport you want to fly into is <a href="http://www.aena.es/csee/Satellite/Aeropuerto-Tenerife-Sur/en/Home.html">Aeropuerto Reina Sofia</a> (Tenerife Sur). There is another airport in the northern part of the island - but it's a long drive from there to Adeje & surrounding areas!</p>
              <p>Both Ryanair & Aer Lingus fly into Tenerife from Dublin & Cork. For Ryanair, you can book on <a href="http://ryanair.ie">their website</a> or via <a href="https://www.google.ie/flights/#search;f=DUB;t=TFS;d=2016-04-11;r=2016-04-17;a=EI,FR">Google Flights</a>. For Aer Lingus, you can use <a href="http://new.aerlingus.com">their website</a> (their flights haven't yet gotten into Google's systems as the route is new). Note that the return leg can be a bit of a <em>party bus</em> as it departs in the evening. If you can, I suggest upgrading your Ryanair seats to the front section of the aircraft, especially if you've got kids. Otherwise just book Aer Lingus, which is more expensive.</p>
              <p><i class="fa fa-3x fa-car text-primary"></i> Most areas are served by bus routes. Dubliners will complain about the times served by the buses & lack of information. Cork people will herald the service as the future of transport. That said, car rental is cheap & easy. Most car rental companies are just inside the airport, but we recommend you book ahead of time. We used <a href="http://www.arcarhire.com/car-hire/car-hire.php">AutoReisen</a> car hire in the past. It's cheaper than other services and easy to use. Also note that taxis are readily available nearly everywhere and reasonably priced.</p>

              <p>We recommend booking accomodation & flights <strong>now</strong>, as the prices are rising.<p>
              <p>Adeje is on the south coast of Tenerife, and is next to Los Cristianos & Las Americas. Las Americas is the busiest area of the island with bars, restaurants & lots of tourists. It also bizarrely has a Hard Rock Cafe the size of a cruise ship for no discernable reason. Los Cristianos is a little quieter, but still a tourist destination. Costa Adeje is quieter in most regards but more expensive to stay in. A walk from Adeje to Las Americas is about 40mins and there's a beautiful coastal route to pub crawl on!</p>
              <p>For the week leading up to the wedding, we will be staying in <a href="http://royalparquealbatros.com/index.html">Royal Park Albatros</a>. It's a typical Spanish villas style place. It's quiet & has a regular bus to Adeje and surrounding areas. Mainly, though, it's a lot cheaper than Adeje. The wedding parties will be staying here for a week (Monday to Monday). Rates are <a style="font-color:#563d7c">€37.59 per night</a>.</p>
              <p>We've also stayed with <a href="https://www.airbnb.ie/s/Costa-Adeje--Spain?guests=&ss_id=aizjoyyf">Airbnb providers</a>. These provide full apartments with lots of amenities in the area, and are typically not as expensive as hotels. Before booking, we recommend you look up the area in Trip Advisor first to ensure it's not too busy/quiet, kid-friendly, etc. depending on your preference. If you need help or advise, just contact us as we've been there a few times & know people who live there!</p>
              <p>Finally, you can also stay with our lovely 5-star venue, the <a href="htt://www.sheratonlacaleta.com/en">Sheraton La Caleta</a> Hotel. There is a special rate for rooms given to wedding guests, below:<br>
                <ul><li>Deluxe room (double for single use): € 101,65 / night</li>
                  <li>Deluxe room (double use):  € 139,10 / night</li>
                  <li>Superior room (double for single use):  € 123,05 / night</li>
                  <li>Superior room (double use): € 160,50 / night</li>
                  <li>Premium room (double for single use):  € 144,45 / night</li>
                  <li>Premium room (double use):  € 181,90 / night</li></u;></p>
              <p><strong>Important:</strong> While accommodation is obviously important for the stay, booking your flights as far ahead of time is nearly vital to getting a good price.
